/*
 
 What are the attitudes, practices, and processes at
 organizations that you think most hurt cyber-security?
 
 1. Time not worth it to spend 2-3 months to test and ensure security.
 
 2. Organization system architecture puts cyber security front and center. However, software development of many programs made cyber-security 3rd or 4th on the list of concerns.

/*
 
 You have one day to help improve a developer's understanding of
 how to improve software security. What would be the ten items that
 you would put on the list and why?
 
 1. Understand the types of threats (SQL Injection, XSS, etc.)
        - This can help the developer understand how to prevent these attacks to code properly
        - to battle against it.
 2. Knowing how to audit software and identify what to look for that could lead to security incidents
        - During code review, one can catch mistakes that might otherwise make into production.
        - Dependency updates
 3. Knowing resources to use to research CVEs
        - NIST, MITRE, RedHat
 4. Understanding past security incidents
        - To prevent implementing the causes in future development
 5. Staying on top of updates
        - Updated software typically comes with important security patches.
 6. Understanding how to securely implement authorization protocols
        - Since most applications implement authorization to use their apps and prevent unauthorized access to features and sensitive information
 7. Software testing
        - To test as many things as possible to create software that is hopefully as secure as possible
